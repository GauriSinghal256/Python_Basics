🔹 Why use __balance with double underscores?
In Python, when you write a variable like __balance, you're telling Python to make it private by using name mangling.

✅ What is a Private Variable?
A private variable is a variable that should not be accessed directly from outside the class.

Python doesn’t enforce strict privacy (like some other languages), but it uses convention and name mangling to make variables "private-ish".

🔑 Rules:
Prefix	                           Access Level	                   Meaning
no underscore	                   Public	                       Can be accessed anywhere.
_single_underscore	               Protected	                   Meant for internal use (can be accessed but not recommended).
__double_underscore	               Private	                       Name mangled to prevent direct access.

🔍 Example: Name Mangling in Action

class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.__balance = balance

acc = BankAccount(1000)

# print(acc.__balance)  # ❌ Will raise AttributeError

# But we can access it like this (not recommended):
print(acc._BankAccount__balance)  # ✅ 1000
🔸 Why does this work?
Python changes __balance to _BankAccount__balance internally to avoid accidental access.

✅ Why use private variables at all?
To enforce encapsulation, like:

Preventing accidental changes to important variables.
Controlling how variables are accessed or modified (e.g., using getter/setter methods).


❓Why is your __balance not truly private, even though you wrote self.__balance?
Because in Python, nothing is truly private.
Python follows the principle of "we are all consenting adults here", meaning:

"You can access private data, but you shouldn't."

🔍 What actually happens when you write __balance?
Python performs name mangling:

self.__balance → becomes → self._BankAccount__balance
So technically, the variable still exists, just under a new "mangled" name.

That's why this works:

print(acc._BankAccount__balance)  ✅
Even though this fails:

print(acc.__balance)  ❌ AttributeError
🛡️ So is it private or not?
Term	        Meaning in Python
Public	        Can be accessed freely (self.balance)
Protected	    Meant to be internal (self._balance)
Private	        Name-mangled to discourage access (self.__balance)

🔐 __balance is private by convention, not by force.

| Pillar        | Purpose                         | Keyword/Concept            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Encapsulation | Hides internal state            | Private variables, methods |
| Abstraction   | Shows only essential features   | `@abstractmethod`, `ABC`   |
| Inheritance   | Reuse code from another class   | `class B(A):`              |
| Polymorphism  | Same method behaves differently | Overriding                 |



✅ What is Operator Overloading?
Operator Overloading means giving custom behavior to operators (+, -, *, ==, etc.) when they are used with user-defined objects (your own classes).

In other words:

You can define how Python should treat +, -, *, etc. for your objects.

🔍 Real Example:

print(3 + 4)           # 7 (for integers)
print("Hello " + "World")  # "Hello World" (for strings)
👉 Here, + works differently for different types — this is overloading!

🧠 How can we use it in our class?
You define magic methods like:

Operator	Method
+	__add__()
-	__sub__()
*	__mul__()
/	__truediv__()
==	__eq__()
<	__lt__()
>	__gt__()

✅ Example: Overload +, *, and ==

class Number:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.n = n

    def __add__(self, other):
        return self.n + other

    def __mul__(self, other):
        return self.n * other

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.n == other

a = Number(5)

print(a + 10)   # Calls __add__ → 15
print(a * 3)    # Calls __mul__ → 15
print(a == 5)   # Calls __eq__  → True
🔁 Why use Operator Overloading?
To make custom objects behave more like built-in types.

To make your code cleaner, more readable.

✅ Your Doubt:
“Why use operator overloading when we can just add things in a normal function?”

Let’s break it down simply:

🔹 1. Normal function is fine for simple values (like int, float):

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

print(add(3, 5))  # ✅ 8
No need for operator overloading here — it’s built-in.

🔹 2. But what if we have custom objects?
Let’s say you’re working with a class like this:

class Money:
    def __init__(self, rupees, paise):
        self.rupees = rupees
        self.paise = paise
Now you want to add two Money objects like this:


m1 = Money(10, 50)
m2 = Money(5, 75)

print(m1 + m2)  # ❌ This gives an error unless we overload __add__
Because Python doesn't know how to add two custom Money objects. That's where operator overloading comes in.

✅ So you define __add__ like this:

class Money:
    def __init__(self, rupees, paise):
        self.rupees = rupees
        self.paise = paise

    def __add__(self, other):
        total_paise = self.paise + other.paise
        total_rupees = self.rupees + other.rupees + total_paise // 100
        total_paise = total_paise % 100
        return Money(total_rupees, total_paise)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.rupees} rupees and {self.paise} paise"

m1 = Money(10, 50)
m2 = Money(5, 75)

print(m1 + m2)  # ✅ 16 rupees and 25 paise
🔁 In short:
Case	Use normal function?	Need operator overloading?
Adding integers, floats	✅ Yes	❌ No
Adding custom objects	❌ Not enough	✅ Yes

✅ Why Operator Overloading is Cool:
Makes your objects behave like built-in types.

Improves readability: a + b is cleaner than a.add(b)

Useful in real-life classes: Point, Vector, Matrix, Money, etc.
