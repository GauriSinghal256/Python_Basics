ðŸ”¢ Part 1 â€“ Core Array Manipulations
Create a 1D array from 0 to 20 (inclusive)

Reshape it into a 5x4 matrix

Flatten it back to 1D using two different methods

Extract a submatrix of size 2x3 from the top-right corner

ðŸ”„ Part 2 â€“ Indexing & Slicing
Replace all even numbers in an array with -1

Replace the last column in a 3x3 matrix with all 100s

Reverse an array (1D and 2D)

Extract every 2nd row from a 2D array

âž• Part 3 â€“ Math Ops & Broadcasting
Add a 1D array [1, 2, 3] to each row of a 3x3 matrix

Multiply a 4x4 matrix by 2 using broadcasting

Normalize an array to the range 0 to 1

Given two arrays a and b, check which elements of a are greater than those of b and return a boolean array

ðŸ“Š Part 4 â€“ Stats & Aggregations
Calculate:

Mean

Median

Standard Deviation

Variance
of a random 1D array of size 100

In a 3x3 matrix, find:

Sum along rows

Sum along columns

ðŸŽ² Part 5 â€“ Random & Simulations
Generate:

10 random integers between 50 and 100

A 5x5 matrix with values between 0 and 1 (use np.random.rand)

A reproducible random array using np.random.seed(42)

Simulate 1000 coin tosses (0 for tails, 1 for heads) and count how many heads you got

ðŸ§ª Optional DRDO-style Thinking Question
A sensor array gives you readings in a 10x10 NumPy matrix. Values >90 are considered "critical".

Count how many critical readings are there

Replace all values >90 with 99
